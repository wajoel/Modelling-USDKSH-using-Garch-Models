This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
# main.R
# Load necessary libraries
library(readr)

# Source the functions.R script
source("dataCleaning.R")  # Update the path to where functions.R is located

# Read the data
data <- read_csv("C:/Users/BRAILER/Downloads/EUR_USDHistoricalData.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Call the clean_data function
processed_data <- clean_data(data, to_clipboard = FALSE)
head(processed_data, 10)
str(processed_data)
```
```{r}
source("summaryStatistics.R")
# Call the summary_statistics function to get the summary statistics
summary_stats <- summary_statistics(processed_data)
summary_stats
```



```{r}
source("datafizualization.R")
# Call the time_series_plot function to visualize the time series data
time_series_plot(processed_data)
```

```{r}
source("adfTest.R")
# Example usage with 'Price' column from your data set
check_stationarity(processed_data$Price)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
